Hello!

I built this platform for learning purposes. It's a Software as a Service project where developers meet investors. 

Features: 

    - Authentication (Free and Pro users)
    
    - User settings
    
    - Form validation
    
    - Mailer
    
    - Secure user pages
    

Uses Stripe and Figaro gems for handling payments. 
Uses Devise for user authentication. 
Uses paperclip for picture uploads (too bad Heroku doesn't allow picture uploads).

Thanks for visiting!
